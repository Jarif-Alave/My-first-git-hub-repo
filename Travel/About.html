        <p class="m-5 text-success-emphasis">Our story of ours sucess in our coriur Every man’s dream is to be successful but achieving success is in your hands. Success begins with someone’s efforts and hard work. If a person has a goal and does not try to fulfil his goal, then he can never achieve success. To be successful, a person needs to work hard and put in a lot of effort. To achieve your goal, you need to chase after it, and you must be dedicated. Hard work and dedication are the two mantras of being successful. The meaning of success might differ from one person to the other, but the pleasure of being successful is incomparable. For some people, being successful means having a lot of money and becoming rich but being successful is much more important than being rich. Our parents and teachers ask us to work hard and focus on our studies so that we achieve success and be capable enough of finding the path to success.</p>

        <p class="m-3">I couldn’t sleep the night before. I was just too excited. This was my first time on a camping trip. I had packed my backpack 3 days ago. There was a list of things that were required from everyone such as sleeping bags, torchlight, matches, Mars Energy Bars and not forgetting mosquito repellants.

          Around 8am the following day, we arrived in our school bus at the foothills of Gunung Ledang which is famous for its many myths and also beautiful camping spots. There were 20 of us. We were all in our school scouts team accompanied by two teachers and our guide, an Orang Asli man called Adun. First we went to register ourselves at the rangers office before starting our hike.It was a wonderful, cool morning. Adun pointed out to us various types of edible wild plants and told us to 'respect the jungle' by not littering or thinking bad thoughts. 2 hours later we reached a waterfall. It was a perfect spot to set up our tents. By the time we finished setting up the tents, it was lunch time. Adun showed us how to gather firewood and lit up a fire. He made a makeshift stand over the fire and hung a pot of icy water from the waterfall to boil. While waiting to cook rice, our teachers said we could all go for a quick swim in the waterfall. We had so much fun together!
